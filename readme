#use ssh:git@github.com:qiaojianqj/learnGit.git
git remote add origin https://github.com/qiaojianqj/learnGit.git

#push contents of the local repository to the remote repository

#later, push:git push origin master
git push -u origin master

#Often when push faild, Fetch from and merge with another repository or a local branch

#clone a repository from remote repository to local using ssh
git clone git@github.com:qiaojianqj/learnGit.git

#look up branches
git branch
